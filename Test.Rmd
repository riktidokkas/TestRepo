##Learning Goals

* Static documents: what options are out there?
    * A focus on markdown.
* Dynamic documents: produce documents that integrate text with code for the analysis that the text presents.


* Produce documents in a variety of output formats (HTML/PDF/Word)

##Part 1: Static Documents

In this section, we'll look at:

* The types of static documents
* Reproducibility of static documents

##List



1. Item 1
2. Item 2

But here is a trick

2. Item 3

##We built a linear regression model.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 3, fig.height=2, fig.align='center'}
m1 <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
plot(m1)
```

The slope of the regression is `r coef(m1)[1]`.
